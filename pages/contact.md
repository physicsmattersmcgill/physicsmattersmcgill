The outreach group in the Department of Physics at McGill University aims to communicate the excitement and fascination of physics to the public, in classrooms, and other interested groups. Contact us at <{{ site.email }}> for information about school visits, teacher information, or other collaborations.

# Interested in volunteering?

Physics Matters is always happy to count on more student, postdoc, and faculty volunteers. Student volunteers may be eligible for McGill's [co-curricular record program](https://www.mcgill.ca/involvement/ccr).

To the question 'Why should I take precious time off my research or classwork to do physics outreach?', here are a couple of answers:

- Help inform the public about the importance of physics in the real world.
- Be a positive role model for kids and young adults interested in science
- Develop strong science communication skills.
- Broaden your network and opens doors to alternate career paths after graduation.
- Practice your French or English.

Interested? Send an email to <{{ site.email }}> and we will add you to the Physics Matters volunteers email list where you will hear about planning meetings and volunteer opportunities.
