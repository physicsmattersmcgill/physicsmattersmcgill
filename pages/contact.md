<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}McGill_CCR_Approval_Seal.png" alt="Seal of approval for the CCR program" style="height:200px; float:left; padding-right:10px;"/> Physics Matters is always happy to count on more student, postdoc, and faculty volunteers. Student volunteers may be eligible for McGill's [co-curricular record program](https://www.mcgill.ca/involvement/ccr).

To the question 'Why should I take precious time off my research or classwork to do physics outreach?', here are a couple of answers:

- Help inform the public about the importance of physics in the real world.
- Be a positive role model for kids and young adults interested in science
- Develop strong science communication skills.
- Broaden your network and opens doors to alternate career paths after graduation.
- Practice your French or English.

Interested? Send an email to <{{ site.email }}> and we will add you to the Physics Matters volunteers email list where you will hear about planning meetings and volunteer opportunities.
