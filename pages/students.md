## Volunteer Outreach picnic
Every Fall we host an outdoor picnic for McGill students to learn about Physics Outreach, AstroMcGill, and the Equity, Diversity, & Inclusivity Group in the McGill Physics Department. You'll get to learn about the McGill Physics Hackathon, Space Explorers, the Astro/Physics McGill Public Lecture series, the McGill Physics Olympiad, Science in Space: How to Telescope, Observatory Open Houses, and the paid outreach coordinator roles you can apply for in place of a TAship! The picnic has passed for 2022/2023. Stay tuned for 2023/2024.

## Physics Hackathon
The [McGill Physics Hackathon](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/), started in 2016, is an annual hackathon devoted to solving and visualizing physics problems. Participant teams will be challenged to use scientific computing tools and/or microelectronic gadgets to demonstrate a concept, phenomenon or application involving the physical sciences. Volunteers are needed for a variety of different aspects of the event! Email hackathon@physics.mcgill.ca for more information. 

## McGill Physics Olympiad Program
Our [McGill Physics Olympiad Program](/mpop) (MPOP) offers mentorship and practice sessions led by undergraduate and graduate physics students experienced in these competitions. Graduate and undergraduate students are needed to run lectures. Email MPOP@physics.mcgill.ca for more information.

## Space Explorers
Space Explorers is a program that brings hands-on physics experiments to elementary school students around Montreal. Sessions are led by undergraduate and graduate physics students. This year, Space Explorers will be transitioning back to in-person! Volunteers are needed for both French and English school visits. Email outreach@physics.mcgill.ca for more information. 

## Science in Space: How to Telescope
Science in Space: How to Telescope is a new outreach initiative between Physics Matters, MSI, and Dell Technologies. Over the course of 10 weeks, middle school students of under-represented genders in physics build telescopes in Minecraft. Under-represented genders in physics with some background in astronomy are needed as mentors for school visits! Email scienceinspace@physics.mcgill.ca for more information.

## Public Lectures 
Every month, we organize a public talk aimed at a broad audience. Speakers are usually McGill Physics or MSI professors, postdocs, or graduate students. Some volunteers are needed to help with set-up and take down for each event. Email Email outreach@physics.mcgill.ca for more information.
