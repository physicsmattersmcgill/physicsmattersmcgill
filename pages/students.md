Each year we host an open house for students interested in seeing what our department is all about. Watch the [events page]({{ site.baseurl }}/events) for more details.

## Physics Hackathon
The [McGill Physics hackathon](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon2017/), started in 2016, is a hackathon devoted to solving and visualizing physics problems. Participant teams will be challenged to use scientific computing tools and/or microelectronic gadgets to demonstrate a concept, phenomenon or application involving the physical sciences.
