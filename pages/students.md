## Outreach picnic
Every Fall we host an outdoor picnic for McGill students to learn about Physics Outreach, AstroMcGill, and the Equity, Diversity, & Inclusivity Group in the McGill Physics Department. You'll get to learn about the McGill Physics Hackathon, Space Explorers, the Astro/Physics McGill Public Lecture series, the McGill Physics Olympiad, Science in Space: How to Telescope, Observatory Open Houses, and the paid outreach coordinator roles you can apply for in place of a TAship! The picnic has passed for 2022/2023. Stay tuned for 2023/2024.

## Open House
Interested in pursuing an undergraduate physics degree? Wondering what kind of research happens in the physics department at McGill? Each year we host an open house for students interested in seeing what our department is all about. Visit the [event page](https://www.mcgill.ca/openhouse/open-house) for more details.

## Physics Hackathon
The [McGill Physics Hackathon](http://www.physics.mcgill.ca/hackathon/), started in 2016, is an annual hackathon devoted to solving and visualizing physics problems. Participant teams will be challenged to use scientific computing tools and/or microelectronic gadgets to demonstrate a concept, phenomenon or application involving the physical sciences. **Everyone** is invited - from high school to post-doc! 

## McGill Physics Olympiad Program
Are you a high school or CEGEP student interested in competitive physics olympiads? Our [McGill Physics Olympiad Program](/mpop) (MPOP) offers mentorship and practice sessions led by undergraduate physics students experienced in these competitions.
