# What is MPOP?
The "McGill Physics Olympiad Program (MPOP)" is a student-run initiative which aims to prepare high school and CEGEP students in the Montreal area for prestigious competitions such as the [Sir Isaac Newton (SIN) exam](https://uwaterloo.ca/sir-isaac-newton-exam/), [Canadian Association of Physicists (CAP) exam](http://outreach.phas.ubc.ca/exams-and-competitions/cap-high-school-prize-exam/), [Canadian Physics Oympiad (CPO)](http://cpo.phas.ubc.ca/), and the [International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)](http://ipho.org/).

# How does it work?
We hold training sessions approximately once a week and last around two to three hours on the McGill campus. Sessions cover special topics in physics found in Olympiads and problem-solving strategies. For homework, participants are assigned challenging problems, some of which will be taken up in the next lecture; solving the problems is ultimately the responsibility of the student.  Participants can either join the "Stream 1" or "Stream 2" program, which are geared for CEGEP levels respectively.

# Who should sign-up?
The type of person who should sign-up for this program is a high-school or CEGEP student who is passionate about physics, loves to solve puzzles and would like to be challenged beyond the standard expectations. Although we give these sessions in English, the Olympiads can be written in either French or English. We encourage individuals who are female and/or from underrepresented groups to sign-up!

It could also be advantageous if participating students have some familiarity with more advanced physics concepts and calculus, but this is not required.  Moreover, exceptional performance within these contests are well recognized within top universities in the United States, United Kingdom and elsewhere.

# How to join?
Coming soon!

# How much does it cost?
MPOP is free of charge! If you're a passionate CEGEP or high-school student and would like to learn more than what's taught in your physics classes, then you are more than welcome to join us!   

# Who is running the program?
MPOP is entirely student run! Sessions are led by graduate students with visits from physics professors at McGill.
