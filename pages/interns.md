# Physics Matters Summer Internships
The Physics Matters outreach group has several summer internships available for Montreal area CEGEP or undergraduate students. Students work in teams on a variety of interesting projects that explore applications combining physics theory and experimental design.

In 2017, two groups were hosted at McGill. One worked in designing a new experiment to explore the properties of electricity and magnetism. The second group designed a biometric sensor which converted human footsteps into electrical signals that were analyzed to detect differences between the footsteps of two different humans. The journey of this second group of interns is summarized in this short video.

We look forward to hosting interns again in 2018. For more information, CEGEP educators or students can [contact the outreach committee](mailto:{{ site.email }}) directly.
