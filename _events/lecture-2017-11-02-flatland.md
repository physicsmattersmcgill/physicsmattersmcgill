title: "The Beautiful Two-dimensional World: An Exploration of Flatworld"
meta_description: Prof. Michael Hilke from the Department of Physics at McGill University will talk about his research on special types of materials, such as graphene. He talk will go into the two-dimensional lives of electrons living on these special materials.

*Abstract:*
We experience our lives in a three dimensional spatial world. What would life be like if one dimension would be missing? This is not science fiction, but corresponds to the world of electrons in special types of materials, such as graphene. Graphene, a Nobel prized material (2010) is as flat as it gets, it is only one atom thick. Yet, in this dimensionally challenged world, new perspectives emerge. In fact new particles only exist in this world, such as anyons. Moreover, charges can fractionalize, electrons can separate into spin and charge, new exotic topologies (for which last yearâ€™s Nobel prize was awarded) can form. In this talk, I will explore the facets of this flat world.
