*Abstract:*
Reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) will improve our quality of life, hydropower is the new green gold, Canada is a great energy power. These myths, and many others, are constantly being repeated by politicians, interest groups, industry spokespersons and the media. They give us the impression of mastering the energy transition and comfort us in the illusion that we can safely continue with our way of doing things by protecting the status quo. This presentation, based on my book of the same title published by Éditions du Boréal and released at the end of February, debunks each of these myths and demonstrates the following truth: the solution to climate change issues is not foremost of technological or scientific nature, but is fundamentally political.
