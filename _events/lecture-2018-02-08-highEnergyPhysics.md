*Abstract:*
The Large Hadron Collider is the largest scientific instrument ever built.  It crosses the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva and is used to study and search for the basic building blocks of the universe by colliding the highest energy proton beams ever produced in such an accelerator.  The Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment (CMS) at the Large Hadron Collider is one of two experiments that discovered the Higgs Boson in 2012, which led to a Nobel Prize in Physics for the original proponents of the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking and generation of mass for the fundamental particles such as electrons, quarks and heavy gauge bosons: the things which make up me, you and the cosmos.  Dr. Dominguez will explain how physicists use these incredible devices to discover the truth about how the universe really works.
