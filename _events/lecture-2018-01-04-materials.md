*Abstract:*
Sustainability is concerned with ensuring that future generations can have access to physical and energy resources. In this presentation, some of the challenges of sustainability are presented in the context of chemistry. We will cover a few examples of how chemistry can offer a solution to sustainability, such as using iron to replace precious metals in important industrial processes or using less energy to access novel materials.
