meta_description: Prof. Robert Brandenberger from McGill University will talk about his research on the origins of the universe. We will explore how seeds laid down in the very early universe developed into the large-scale structure we observe today, and how this may teach us about the beginnings of the universe.

*Abstract:*
Cosmology is a natural meeting ground between fundamental theory (e.g. superstring theory or quantum gravity) and observations. This lecture
explores how seeds laid down in the very early universe developed into the large-scale structure we observe today, and how this may teach us about the beginnings of the universe.
