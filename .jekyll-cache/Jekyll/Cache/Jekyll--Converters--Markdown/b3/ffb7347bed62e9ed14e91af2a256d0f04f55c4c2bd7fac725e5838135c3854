<p>What were Albert Einsteinâ€™s first wifeâ€™s contributions to his extraordinary productivity in the first years of his career? The first biography of Mileva MariÄ‡ was published in Serbian in 1969 and remained largely unknown until it was translated first in German, then in French in the 1990â€™s. A doubt has subsisted ever since. More recent sources have shed more light on her life, allowing us to finally get a better idea on the contributions of Mileva MariÄ‡.</p>
