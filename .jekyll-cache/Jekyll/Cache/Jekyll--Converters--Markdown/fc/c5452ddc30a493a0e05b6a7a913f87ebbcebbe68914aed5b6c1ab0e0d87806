I"Œ<p><em>Abstract:</em>
Quantum entanglement is a non-local correlation between objects that is only possible due to the strange principles of quantum mechanics. As strange as it is, entanglement is everywhere at the atomic scale. However, for a long time scientists havenâ€™t studied how entanglement is organized in a given system but have instead focused on its consequences. In recent years, the â€œentanglement revolutionâ€ has put the focus back on this fundamental concept. Iâ€™ll discuss how this revolution is changing our understanding of matter, ranging from superconductors to ultra-cold gases, and Iâ€™ll even touch upon string theory!</p>
