<p>Climate science has concentrated on proving the theory that the post-industrial warming is largely caused by human agency and last year, the International Panel on Climate Change upgraded its assessment of the theory from â€œlikelyâ€ to â€œextremely likelyâ€. Meanwhile, the skeptics have continued to tout their theory that the warming is simply a giant natural fluctuation. In order to end the scientific part of the debate - to reach â€œclimate closureâ€ - it is therefore necessary to demonstrate that the skepticsâ€™ competing giant fluctuation theory has such a low probability that it can be confidently dismissed. We summarize a new and straightforward disproof that achieves this closure with 99.9% confidence so that the only viable explanation is anthropogenic.</p>

<p>I describe a scientific breakthrough that exploits the atmosphereâ€™s extreme instability - the â€œbutterfly effectâ€ â€“ the cause of a special type of randomness with a memory that is so enormous that we are still feeling the effects of century - old fluctuations. Randomness with elephantine memory not only leads to climate closure, it also leads to improved seasonal, annual and decadal forecasts.</p>
